            <h1>A day in the life of a student on the 4th floor of the Diamond</h1>
            <p>The average student will spend a significant amount of their own time at university studying. This is an account of a day spent on the Diamond's 4th floor.</p>
            <h2>My day</h2>

                <h3>9am Arrive at the Diamond</h3>
                <p>
                    I didn't have any lectures in the morning, only a meeting with a project group. Seeing as I still had a task to complete before meeting up with my group, 
                    I got into the Diamond slightly early to get it done. I got out a laptop from the loan lockers and sat at a desk in the silent study area to get it done. 
                    It's been a while since I last forgot my pin, but the first couple of times I tried to take out a laptop I kept forgetting it and had to go and check at 
                    the CICS helpdeck computer!

                <h3>10.30am Meeting with project group</h3>
                <p>
                    My project group had a group study roomed booked for an hour, so at 10.30 we all met up and went in. We each took turns connecting our laptops to the 
                    big screen so we could talk the rest through all the work we had done on each of our delegated tasks since the last time we met. I really like having the 
                    screens to use because it makes it so much easier to discuss work when everyone isn't crowded over a sinlge laptop.

                <div class="textbox">
                    <p>
                        We still had things to discuss and work on together after our time slot for the group study was finished, so we decided to puch some tables together 
                        in the flexispace and work there. This was very useful seeing as we were a group of 7, and that would usually mean squashing around fixed tables intended 
                        for fewer people. The noise is always pretty reasonable in the flexispace, not loud to the point of where you can't hear people sitting next to you, and 
                        and still not too quiet where you feel awkward speaking.

                <h3>12pm Lunch and independent study</h3>
                <p>After finishing up with my group, I decided to stay in and do some more work on my own. I had some lecture notes to go over and an assignment to be getting on 
                    with. I decided I would rather work in the large silent study area than stay in the flexispace. I put back my laptop and after a bit of looking found a computer desk. 
                    There's often not a lot of free table space, so you have to be either quick or lucky to find a spot. The computers in the Diamond pretty much all have any 
                    programs you might need, so that means you don't have to be picky about what rooms you can go to which is nice. I stayed in the silent study until just before 3, when 
                    I packed up my things and headed downstairs to my first lecture of the day.
