                    <p>The flexispace is an  area where students can study how they like. It doesn't have the same noise restrictions 
                    as the silent study spaces do. This makes it better suited to working in groups, especially since you can arrange the tables
                    in any formation you like. It is located in the centre of the top floor, giving it good access to all the other facilities on the floor.</p>

                    <p>
                        The are many silent study areas on the top floor of the Diamond. These provide a large volume of students with a place to get work done in peace and quiet. 
                        These spaces have a combination of computers and desk space, making them very useful for practically all types of study.

                    <p>
                        The top floor has many group study rooms to work in. These have to be booked in order to be used, this can be done either through the iSheffield app or 
                        <a href="https://sheffieldcics.getconnect2.com/">MUSE</a>. This can be done up to 2 days in advance, and the rooms tend to go very fast so it's best to 
                        book as quickly as possible. These rooms have a large meeting style table and a large screen on one wall at the end. Ports are available to plug in a laptop to the screen 
                        for presenting or just showing something to the group.

                        The Diamond has a range of different creative media facilities that are available for any student to book out and use. There are edit suite workstations 
                        where students get to use a high spec computer equipped for video editing, audio editing, image editing, screencasting and animation in a room with many stations. 
                        As well as this, there are media booths which are small editing rooms that can be booked which have high spec computers equipped for all the same as the workstations, 
                        but also are capable of audio recording. There is also a podcast studio and a TV studio. All these can be booked using 
                        the iSheffield App or <a href="https://sheffieldcics.getconnect2.com/">MUSE</a>.

                    <p>
                        Students can loan out laptops using their Ucard and pin from a large set of lockers next to the CICS helpdesk. They can be kept for up to 24 hours 
                        but cannot be taken out of the building. Each laptop comes with a charger in a packet which also must not leave the bulding. When returning the laptops, 
                        they must be plugged in to the charger inside of the locker so it can detect that the laptop has been returned. The student is liable for the laptop they 
                        take out and if it is damaged must pay for its repair/replacement.
