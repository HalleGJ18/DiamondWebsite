# DiamondWebsite
https://hallegj18.github.io/DiamondWebsite/

A student's guide to the 4th floor of the University of Sheffield's Diamond building.  
Built for first year web design module in December 2019.  
Written from scratch using only HTML and CSS and JavaScript for a hamburger menu, since the assignment brief specified that we could not use Bootstrap or any frameworks for this.
