            <h1>Welcome to this unofficial guide to the 4th Floor of the Diamond at the University of Sheffield!</h1>
            
            <p>The Diamond is home to the faculty of engineering here at the University of Sheffield, facilitating many different courses and disciplines. Opened in 2015, the builing cost 
                Â£81 million and contains lecture theatres, seminar rooms, IT services, study spaces, library, media booths, laboratories, a recording studio and computer rooms. 
                It is available 24/7 to all students, not just in those engineering.
            </p>

            <p>
                Located right next to St George's Church and a short walk from the Student's Union, the Arts Tower and the Information Commons, the Diamond is in a prime position on 
                the university campus. It is very easy to access the majority of the University's facilities from it, and it's only approximately 15 minutes walk from the city centre.
            </p>
            
            <p>The 4th floor contains a lot of the building's independent study spaces, with lots of silent and group study areas. It is where many students find themselves using their 
                time between lectures to get work done. One of the most important things in university is getting into good studying habits, something that can be made much easier by having 
                a decent place to work.
